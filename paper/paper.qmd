# Introduction

You can and should cross-reference sections and sub-sections. We use @citeR and @rohan.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data....



# Data {#sec-data}

Some of our data is of penguins (@fig-bills), from @palmerpenguins.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bills
#| fig-cap: Bills of penguins
#| echo: false

```

Talk more about it.

And also planes (@fig-planes). (You can change the height and width, but don't worry about doing that until you have finished every other aspect of the paper - Quarto will try to make it look nice and the defaults usually work well once you have enough text.)

```{r}
#| label: fig-planes
#| fig-cap: Relationship between wing length and width
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false

```

Talk way more about it. 



# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.


# Results

Our results are summarized in @tbl-modelresults.

# Discussion

## First discussion point {#sec-first-point}

If my paper were 10 pages, then should be be at least 2.5 pages. The discussion is a chance to show off what you know and what you learnt from all this. 

## Second discussion point

## Third discussion point

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
